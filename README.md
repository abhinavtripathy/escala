# Escala 

## An Independent Study of Scalability Through Docker & Containers

> Escala: *Spannish* for Scale

- Student: Abhinav Tripathy 
- Professor: Tim Richards 
- Topic: Exploring scalability through Docker and Building a stress testing tool

## Core Focus 

The core focus of the study would be to explore containers as an idea and docker as a tool to show various ways in which scalability could be achieved and how to think about scalability. Specifically, the study would explore how to use docker containers as a tool to achieve scalability in web systems. 

The other part of the study would be to build a tool/system that would help students evaluate their web systems, specifically a tool that stress tests their applications given the various endpoints. The tool should give students some metrics that are consistent, measurable and repeatable.
